Here is Yifan Jia.

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering(Chongxin College), Shandong University in China,supervised by  Yuntao Du. 
My primary research interests focus on multimodal learning, generative models, and interpretability.

Specifically, my research focuses on AI systems based on MLLMs, such as RAG and Agents. My previous work has concentrated on knowledge conflicts in MLLMs and prompt/context engineering. At the same time, I am also very interested in generative systems based on multimodal learning, such as T2I, T2V, and 3D generation.I enjoy exploring the essence of things, which makes me very interested in interpretability. I view interpretability as an analytical tool that helps us understand the effectiveness of AI systems, for example, through data attribution.


Looking to the future, I am currently applying for the PHD/Mphil program of 26Fall. If you are interested in any aspect of me that I would like to chat about and collaborate with, please email me at 2597077223jyf[at]gmail.com
